Important Concepts and functionalties in the code except preprocessing of data.
Data Initialization (__init__ method):

The __init__ method initializes the necessary data and attributes when an instance of the Recommender class is created. It calls various methods to retrieve data from CSV files and store it in instance variables.
Random Product Recommendations (getProductRecommendation function):

In the getProductRecommendation function, random product recommendations are generated. After identifying products similar to the user's browsing history, the code selects a subset of random products for recommendations.
Data Indexing (getSingleProductRecommendation function):

The getSingleProductRecommendation function uses indexing and sorting techniques to recommend products based on their correlation with a specific product. It sorts products based on their correlation values.
Printing Recommendations (getSingleProductRecommendation and getProductRecommendation functions):

The code includes print statements to display recommendations to the user. These print statements are used to demonstrate the recommended products.
User-Specific Recommendations (getProductRecommendation function):

The getProductRecommendation function generates personalized product recommendations based on a specific user's browsing history and search queries.
Attribute Weights (getCorrelationMatrix function):

The getCorrelationMatrix function calculates the correlation matrix using attribute weights, such as price, date, name similarity, brand similarity, and brand preference. These weights contribute to the calculation of correlations.
Instance Variables (self variables):

Throughout the code, instance variables (e.g., self.orderDetails, self.products, self.correlationData) are used to store and access data across different methods within the class.
Mathematical Operations (np.corrcoef):

The np.corrcoef function from the NumPy library is used to calculate the correlation coefficients between product attributes.
Data Persistence (correlationData.csv):

The code assumes the presence of CSV files containing data for order history, browsing history, products, and correlation data. These files provide the necessary input for generating recommendations.
Overall, the code combines data retrieval, preprocessing, correlation calculations, and recommendation generation to create a simplified product recommendation system. It's important to note that the provided code is a starting point and can be extended and customized based on your specific data, requirements, and real-world use case.


Preprocessing Steps:


getDateWeights(self, userId):

Preprocessing: This function calculates normalized date weights for products based on order dates.
Explanation: The order dates are converted into timestamps, and these timestamps are used to calculate normalized weights between 0 and 1. This preprocessing ensures that recent orders are given higher importance in recommendations.
Key Steps:
Loop through user's order history to find maximum and minimum order timestamps.
Normalize order timestamps to calculate weights based on recency.
Return an array of normalized date weights.
getBrandDataWeights(self, userId):

Preprocessing: This function calculates brand data weights based on a user's order history.
Explanation: It assigns a value of 1 to brands the user has ordered from, indicating brand preferences. This preprocessing helps incorporate user-specific preferences into the recommendation process.
Key Steps:
Loop through user's order history to identify brands the user has ordered from.
Assign a value of 1 to brands that have been ordered from and store in an array.
Return an array of brand data weights.
getProductRecommendation(self, userId):

Preprocessing: Fuzzy string matching is used to find products similar to the user's search queries.
Explanation: This step preprocesses the search queries to identify products that match the user's browsing history based on text similarity.
Key Steps:
Loop through user's search queries and loop through all products to find products with high string similarity.
Generate a list of products similar to the search queries.
getCorrelationMatrix(self, userId):

Preprocessing: Normalized attribute data (price, date, name similarity, brand similarity, brand preference) are used for correlation calculations.
Explanation: Attributes are normalized and used to calculate correlations between products.
Key Steps:
Normalize attributes such as price, date, name similarity, brand similarity, and brand preference.
Calculate the correlation matrix using the normalized attributes.
Return the correlation matrix.
getUserOrderHistory(self, userId):

Preprocessing: None.
Explanation: This function retrieves the order history of a specific user and returns it.
Key Steps:
Retrieve the user's order history using the provided user ID.
Return the user's order history.
getUserBrowseHistory(self, userId):

Preprocessing: None.
Explanation: This function retrieves the browsing history of a specific user and returns it.
Key Steps:
Retrieve the user's browsing history using the provided user ID.
Return the user's browsing history.
In these functions, preprocessing is used to transform and prepare data for generating personalized product recommendations. Preprocessing steps such as normalizing attributes, identifying brand preferences, and using fuzzy string matching contribute to enhancing the recommendation system's ability to provide relevant and personalized suggestions to users.
